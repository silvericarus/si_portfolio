      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a software developer from Spain, also known as <b>silvericarus</b>.
        I have always felt comfortable with technology and computers, since I was a kid,<br>
        even when I didn't know what I wanted my job to be in the future. When I first studied web development
        I found out I loved the posibilities that HTML gave me to create new pages.<br>
        In that moment, I knew I wanted to work designing creative and useful apps, and when I learned
        many more languages, the ideas I thought for apps I could create only grew.
